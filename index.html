        <h3>My GA Experience</h3>
        <p>I’ve just finished my Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. Few of the marvelous things I learned there are React, Java Script in as many forms as possible, Ruby on Rails and a bunch of things that are listed down below so read on!</p>
        <h3>Long story short</h3>
        <p>I’ve been programming since January, when I started Computer Systems Engineering at Newcastle University. I did not want to stay there, because I wanted to go and experience the real world of working in programming. I did not want to spend at least 4 years at university just to get the work, which lead me to joining GA. After 3 months there I am so happy I made that choice and now I’m thrilled to go and pursue my professional career!</p>
        <h3>What else do I do?</h3>
        <p>Besides programming I love creating music. I have a small section about it if you want to have a listen! I’m also a huge DIY fan. From building and constantly fixing my electric bike, to simple smart home implementation with Raspberry Pie, to a bunch of speakers I created from old radios. I’m currently planning out my next project involving converting a car to electric.</p>
        <h3>Few words about me</h3>
        <p>I love learning, especially from other people. I usually spend my free time on (over)researching my new hobbies. I am inspired by other people’s great ideas and unique approaches and love working in an environment with people who have those. I do not mind critique at all, quite the opposite -  I appreciate it.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">December 2019</p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://notes-d5887.firebaseapp.com/">NotAble</a> is an app which enables user to create, save and edit <strong>Markdown</strong> documents and see the renders in real time. I created it using <strong>React and Firebase</strong>. I used <strong>SASS</strong> for styling. To authenticate users I used methods provided by Firebase. I also implemented their <strong>NoSQL Database</strong> to store user information and notes.
            </p>
            <p>As a personal project I recreated the same front-end functionality with <strong>Svelte</strong></p>
            <p>Here's my <a href="#">code</a>!</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">November 2019</p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.betyourfriend.com.au/">Betyourmate</a> is an app for resolving "Gentlemens' agreements involving money". This <strong>mobile-first</strong> website was created as a group project using <strong>React, Redux, SCSS</strong> and a bit of <strong>Bootstrap</strong> for the front end. For the backend we used <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, with Active Storage for storing profile images. We implemented <strong>JWT user authentication</strong>. Both sides are hosted on <strong>Heroku</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>The future of the project is on an app and that's what we're working right now. We will be using <strong>React Native</strong> to build out an app for both systems and <strong>AWS/Firebase</strong> for the backend</p>
            <p>We used Github to manage the project between us. <strong>Branching</strong> was a lifesaver for trying out new features.</p>
            <p>Our code is private, as we are planning to continue working on this app, but here is a <a href="#">Github repo</a> with public Readme which is going into detail of how the app works.</p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://boomboxv2-unique.herokuapp.com/">Boombox</a> is my first more advanced app created as a personal interface for managing music library. It uses <strong>Spotify API</strong> to get information about every album, artist or song. I built the project using <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. I followed <strong>MVC</strong> structure to display content to the user. <strong>Bootstrap</strong> was implemented on this project to manage the UI elements.

                    <a href="https://react.chrskerr.com/">Burning airlines</a> was my first pair project done with a really short deadline. This project was completed in 3 days using <strong>React and Bootstrap</strong> for the front-end and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> for the back-end and the front-end.

                This project is a flight management tool. All possible flights are listed as an option for people to search and make a reservation for. We used Axios to communicate with the back-end.

            <p>
                <a href="https://aleksanderbrymora.github.io/project0/">TicTacToe</a> was my first project at General Assembly. It was first deep dive into using Javascript, HTML and CSS. I Used <strong>jQuery</strong> for manipulating the DOM and separated it to another file from the game logic file. The game has few over the top animations added using Mojs library. Which was a great first encounter with using external library.

            <p>
                My first use of <strong>Python</strong> was for this proud project. The origins of it stretch back a few years when I was writing macros to do the same thing in Word to make some money of these beautiful things. Not proudest of it but it's one of those things that made me start programming. You can say "teachers hate me for this one simple trick".

            <h3>Caesar and Substitution Cypher in C</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">March 2019</p>
            <p>
                Definitely the most amount of lines in a single file I have ever written. This tool encrypts and decrypts both Caesar and Substitution Cypher when given a key. It also has dictionary based brute-force decryption for Caesar Cypher which is shown on the gif. <strong>C</strong> was one of the first languages I learned so moving to Javascript was a true blessing.
