        <h3>My GA Experience</h3>
        <p>I’ve just finished my Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. Few of the marvelous things I learned there are React, Java Script in as many forms as possible, Ruby on Rails and a bunch of things that are listed down below so read on!</p>
        <h3>Long story short</h3>
        <p>I’ve been programming since January, when I started Computer Systems Engineering at Newcastle University. I did not want to stay there, because I wanted to go and experience the real world of working in programming. I did not want to spend at least 4 years at university just to get the work, which lead me to joining GA. After 3 months there I am so happy I made that choice and now I’m thrilled to go and pursue my professional career!</p>
        <h3>What else do I do?</h3>
        <p>Besides programming I love creating music. I have a small section about it if you want to have a listen! I’m also a huge DIY fan. From building and constantly fixing my electric bike, to simple smart home implementation with Raspberry Pie, to a bunch of speakers I created from old radios. I’m currently planning out my next project involving converting a car to electric.</p>
        <h3>Few words about me</h3>
        <p>I love learning, especially from other people. I usually spend my free time on (over)researching my new hobbies. I am inspired by other people’s great ideas and unique approaches and love working in an environment with people who have those. I do not mind critique at all, quite the opposite -  I appreciate it.</p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">December 2019</p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://notes-d5887.firebaseapp.com/">NotAble</a> is an app which enables user to create, save and edit <strong>Markdown</strong> documents and see the renders in real time. I created it using <strong>React and Firebase</strong>. I used <strong>SASS</strong> for styling. To authenticate users I used methods provided by Firebase. I also implemented their <strong>NoSQL Database</strong> to store user information and notes.

            <p style="font-style: italic;">November 2019</p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.betyourfriend.com.au/">Betyourmate</a> is an app for resolving "Gentlemens' agreements involving money". This <strong>mobile-first</strong> website was created as a group project using <strong>React, Redux, SCSS</strong> and a bit of <strong>Bootstrap</strong> for the front end. For the backend we used <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, with Active Storage for storing profile images. We implemented <strong>JWT user authentication</strong>. Both sides are hosted on <strong>Heroku</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>The future of the project is on an app and that's what we're working right now. We will be using <strong>React Native</strong> to build out an app for both systems and <strong>AWS/Firebase</strong> for the backend</p>
            <p>We used Github to manage the project between us. <strong>Branching</strong> was a lifesaver for trying out new features.</p>
            <p>Our code is private, as we are planning to continue working on this app, but here is a <a href="#">Github repo</a> with public Readme which is going into detail of how the app works.</p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://boomboxv2-unique.herokuapp.com/">Boombox</a> is my first more advanced app created as a personal interface for managing music library. It uses <strong>Spotify API</strong> to get information about every album, artist or song. I built the project using <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. I followed <strong>MVC</strong> structure to display content to the user. <strong>Bootstrap</strong> was implemented on this project to manage the UI elements.
