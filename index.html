    <h3>My GA Experience</h3>
    <p>I’ve just finished my Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. Few of the marvelous things I learned there are React, Java Script in as many forms as possible, Ruby on Rails and a bunch of things that are listed down below so read on!</p>
    <h3>Long story short</h3>
    <p>I’ve been programming since January, when I started Computer Systems Engineering at Newcastle University. I did not want to stay there, because I wanted to go and experience the real world of working in programming. I did not want to spend at least 4 years at university just to get the work, which lead me to joining GA. After 3 months there I am so happy I made that choice and now I’m thrilled to go and pursue my professional career!</p>
    <h3>What else do I do?</h3>
    <p>Besides programming I love creating music. I have a small section about it if you want to have a listen! I’m also a huge DIY fan. From building and constantly fixing my electric bike, to simple smart home implementation with Raspberry Pie, to a bunch of speakers I created from old radios. I’m currently planning out my next project involving converting a car to electric.</p>
    <h3>Few words about me</h3>
    <p>I love learning, especially from other people. I usually spend my free time on (over)researching my new hobbies. I am inspired by other people’s great ideas and unique approaches and love working in an environment with people who have those. I do not mind critique at all, quite the opposite -  I appreciate it.</p>

            <a href="https://notes-d5887.firebaseapp.com/">NotAble</a> is an app which enables user to create, save and edit Markdown documents and see the renders in real time. I created it using React and Firebase. I used SASS for styling.

        <h3>Social betting app</h3>

        <p>
            <a href="https://notes-d5887.firebaseapp.com/">Betyourmate</a> is an app for solving "Gentlemens' agreements involving money". This mobile-first website was created as a group project using React, Redux, SCSS and a bit of Bootstrap for the front end side. For the backend we used Ruby on Rails. We implemented JWT user authentication. Both sides are hosted on Heroku.
        </p>
        <p>We used Github to manage the project between us. Branching was a lifesaver for trying out new features.</p>
