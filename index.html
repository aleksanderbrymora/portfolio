    <h1>Hi! I'm Aleks</h1>
    <p>I’ve just finished my Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. Few of the marvelous things I learned there are React, Java Script in as many forms as possible, Ruby on Rails and a bunch of things that are listed down below so read on!</p>
    <p>I’ve been programming since January, when I started Computer Systems Engineering at Newcastle University. I did not want to stay there, because I wanted to go and experience the real world of working in programming. I did not want to spend at least 4 years at university just to get the work, which lead me to joining GA. After 3 months there I am so happy I made that choice and now I’m thrilled to go and pursue my professional career!</p>
    <p>Besides programming I love creating music. I have a small section about it if you want to have a listen! I’m also a huge DIY fan. From building and constantly fixing my electric bike, to simple smart home implementation with Raspberry Pie, to a bunch of speakers I created from old radios. I’m currently planning out my next project involving converting a car to electric.</p>
    <p>I love learning, especially from other people. I usually spend my free time on (over)researching my new hobbies. I am inspired by other people’s great ideas and unique approaches and love working in an environment with people who have those. I do not mind critique at all, quite the opposite -  I appreciate it.</p>
